## Installation
1. Get the [notehax archive](https://github.com/mrnbayoh/notehax/releases/) according to your region.
2. Extract it to the root of your SD card (the /private folder must be at the root) /!\ If you delete the previous /private folder all your notes saved on the SD card will be lost /!\
3. Download the [otherapp payload](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/) corresponding to your region/console/firmware etc.
4. Copy the otherapp payload to the /notehax folder and rename it "otherapp.bin".
